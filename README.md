Berkeley SFM is a structure from motion library created to explore new solutions
to challenging 3D reconstruction problems (large scale, indoors, incremental,
high uncertainty, etc.). It is developed by Erik Nelson and David
Fridovich-Keil, members of the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center
([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)).
