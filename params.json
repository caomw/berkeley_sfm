{"name":"Berkeley SfM","tagline":"Structure from Motion (SfM) framework by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center.","body":"# [Berkeley S(tructure) f(rom) M(otion)](http://erik-nelson.github.io/berkeley_sfm/)\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/erik-nelson/berkeley_sfm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/erik-nelson/berkeley_sfm)\r\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD-blue.svg)](LICENSE)\r\n\r\nBerkeley SfM is a structure from motion library created to explore new solutions to challenging 3D reconstruction problems (large scale, indoors, incremental, homogeneously textured, etc.). It is developed by **Erik Nelson** and **David Fridovich-Keil**, members of the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)).\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nThis repository is entirely written in C++, and is structured around the CMAKE cross-compilation paradigm. All source code is in the `berkeley_sfm/src/cpp/` directory. We have also written extensive unit tests, which are automatically compiled and tested in continuous integration. The source code for these tests is stored in the `berkeley_sfm/test/` directory, and the test executable will be compiled into `berkeley_sfm/bin/run_tests`.\r\n\r\n## Build Instructions\r\nWe follow the standard CMAKE build scheme. Just download the repository and from the top directory type:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have tested the build process on Mac OSX Yosemite and El Capitan, and on Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty. One difficulty we did encounter is the potential conflict between multiple copies of OpenCV on a system. For example, if you run Anaconda's (and/or Homebrew's) version of OpenCV it may not be compiled properly such that it will link to our repository. If you run into this problem, we suggest uninstalling all versions of OpenCV and rebuilding it from source with the default compiler on your system (not Homebrew's version of gcc/g++).\r\n\r\n## API Documentation\r\nAuto-generated Doxygen API documentation is available [from here](http://erik-nelson.github.io/berkeley_sfm/documentation). Doxygen creates documentation from inline comments in project source and header files. Even though our comments are not tailored to Doxygen best-practices, it seems to do an okay job.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
